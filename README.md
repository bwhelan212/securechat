This program creates a secure chat channel that a client and host can connect to. I implemented public key encryption with 
RAS using python, the socket library, the threading library, and the Cryptodome library. Will re upload wireshark captures
using 127.0.0.1 instead.

I am currently working to create a more secure and efficient secure chat program with a team of students for my cryptography class.
There will be a different method for distributing keys and public key cryptography will not be used for distributing messages because
of the high computational overhead.
